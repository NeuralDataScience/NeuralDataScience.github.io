    "The pages in this section will introduce you to three primary **packages** that are useful for doing data science in Python: [NumPy](https://neuraldatascience.github.io/Chapter_2/NumPy.html), [Pandas](https://neuraldatascience.github.io/Chapter_2/Pandas.html), and [SciPy](https://neuraldatascience.github.io/Chapter_2/SciPy.html). We'll also introduce the concept of version control, and encourage you to think carefully how you comment, organize, and ultimately share your code.\n",
