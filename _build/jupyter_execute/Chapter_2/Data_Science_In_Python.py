# Python is one of the main tools used by data scientists and neuroscientists alike. Python is a coding language that allows us to efficiently and flexibly work with data, run various statistical analyses, and visualize our results.
# 
# The pages in this section will introduce you to three primary **packages** that are useful for doing data science in Python: [NumPy](https://neuraldatascience.github.io/Chapter_2/NumPy.html), [Pandas](https://neuraldatascience.github.io/Chapter_2/Pandas.html), and [SciPy](https://neuraldatascience.github.io/Chapter_2/SciPy.html). We'll also introduce the concept of version control, and encourage you to think carefully how you comment, organize, and ultimately share your code.

# **Resources for Learning Python**
# 
# These notebooks assume that you already have some foundational knowledge about how to use Python. If you are still learning, we recommend the following resources:
# - Online free courses like [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python) and [DataQuest](http://dataquest.io) are great to get started.
# - [The official beginner's guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide), by the folks at Python.
# - Ellis, Donaghue, and Voytek, [COGS 18: Introduction to Python](cogs18.github.io)
# - VanderPlas, [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/)
# - VanderPlas, [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
# - Software Carpentry, [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-plotting/)
