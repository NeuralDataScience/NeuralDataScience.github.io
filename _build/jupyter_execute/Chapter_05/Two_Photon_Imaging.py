# # Two Photon Imaging

# Two-photon calcium imaging is a powerful way to simultaneously image hundreds or even thousands of cells simultaneously. This section will introduce you to several datasets that feature this type of data:
# 
# * The Allen Brain Observatory
# * NWB Two-Photon Data
# * Mesoscope Data from Carsen Stringer
# 
# For an example of what this type of data looks like in action, run the cell below.
