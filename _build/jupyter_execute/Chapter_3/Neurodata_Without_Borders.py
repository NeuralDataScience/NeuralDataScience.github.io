# # Neurodata Without Borders 

# **About NWB**

# - many obstacles in data sharing, especially in neuroscience 
# - there is currently too much data in neuroscience to work with 
# - too much data makes it difficult to share and analyze with scientisits around the worls 
# - "The aim of Neurodata Without Borders is to standardize neuroscience data on an international scale"
# - creating a standard format for neuroscience data will mamke it easier to share and contribute to open soruce projects which will accelerate discovery 

# **Goal**

# - develop a unified, extensible, open-source data format for cellular-based neurophysiology data
# - create a standard for neuroscience datasets to imporve the collaboration of neuroscience projects around the world 

# **Current Conflict**

# - neuroscience does not have a standardized way to collect and share data
# - no common standard means it is difficult for labs to share and compare results with one another 
# - not being able to compare results and replicate experiments slows down the overall progression of the field 

# **Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiolgy**

# - a common standard to share, store, and build analysis tools for neuroscience data 
# - contains software to stadardize data, API's to read and write data, and important datasets in the neuroscience community that have been converted to NWB format 
# - takes into account experimental design, experimental subjects, behavior, data aquisition, neural activity, and extensions
