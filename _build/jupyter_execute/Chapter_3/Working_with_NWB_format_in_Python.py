# ## File Hierarchy: Groups, Datasets, and AttributesÂ¶

# The NWB file is composed of various Groups, Datasets, and Attributes. The data/datasets and cooresponding meta-data are encapsulated within these Groups. The `fields` attribute returns a dictionary contiaining the metadata of the Groups of our nwb file. The dictionary keys are the various Groups within the file which we will use to access our datasets.

# In[4]:


# Get the Groups for the nwb file 
nwb_fields = nwb_file.fields
print(nwb_fields.keys())


# Each NWB file will have information on where the experiment was conducted, what lab conducted the experiment, as well as a description of the experiment. This information can be accessed using `institution`, `lab`, and `experiment_description`, attributes on our nwb_file, respectively.

# In[5]:


# Get Meta-Data from NWB file 
print('The experiment within this NWB file was conducted at {} in the lab of {}. The experiment is detailed as follows: {}'.format(nwb_file.institution, nwb_file.lab, nwb_file.experiment_description))


# We can access metadata from each group in our nwb_file with the following syntax: `nwb_file.group`. This is no different than executing a method and/or attribute. Below we will demonstrate some of the useful groups within an `NWBFile` object. 

# The `acquisition` contains datasets of acquisition data, mainly `TimeSeries` objects belonging to this NWBFile. 

# In[6]:


nwb_file.acquisition


# In this file, the acquisition group contains two different dataets, `lick_left_times` and `lick_right_times` within `lick_times`. To access the actual data array of these datasets we must first subset our dataset of interest from the group. We can then use `data[:]` to return our actual data array.

# In[7]:


# select our dataset of interest 
subgroup = 'lick_times'
dataset = 'lick_right_times'
lick_r_dataset = nwb_file.acquisition[subgroup][dataset]

# return first 10 values in data array 
lick_r_data_array = lick_r_dataset.data[:10]

print(lick_r_data_array)


# The `intervals` group contains all time interval tables from the experiemnt. We can look at the description field in the metadata to understand what each dataset in the group contains.  

# In[8]:


# example showing how to return meta data from groups in nwb file 
nwb_file.intervals


# Within the intervals group is the `trials` dataset which is a `DynamicTable` contianing intervals from our experimental trials. Each column in `trials` is a `VectorData` object and the table can be assigned to a dataframe using `to_dataframe()`.

# In[9]:


# Select the group of interest from the nwb file 
intervals = nwb_file.intervals

# Subset the dataset from the group and assign it as a dataframe
interval_trials_df = intervals['trials'].to_dataframe()
interval_trials_df.head()


# The `description` attribute provides a short description on each column of the dataframe.

# In[10]:


# return the description of each col in our dataframe
for col in intervals['trials'].to_dataframe():
    print(col +':')
    print(intervals['trials'][col].description)
    print('\n')


# The `units` group in our nwb_file contains all our unit metadata including of our neural spike data for scientific analysis. Much like the `intervals` group, `units` is also a `DynamicTable` that can be assigned to a dataframe.

# In[11]:


units = nwb_file.units
units_df = units.to_dataframe()
units_df.head()


# The `electrodes` group contians metadata from the elctrodes used in the experimental trials. Also a `DynamicTable`, the data includes location of the electrodes, type of filtering, and the whats electrode group the electrode belongs to. 

# In[12]:


# electrode positions 
electrodes = nwb_file.electrodes
electrodes_df = electrodes.to_dataframe()
electrodes_df.head()
