# # Teaching and Learning with NWB Datasets

# ## Overview

# ### This is a work in progress.
# 
# This online textbook will provide interactive resources for researchers, educators, and students who would like to use open neuroscience datasets for research and teaching. This book will provide tutorials in the form of interactive notebooks and videos for how to use Python to wrangle neuroscience datasets, with a focus on [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) datasets.
