# ## Chapter 2 Problem Set
# 
# 1. In [Chapter 2.1](https://neuraldatascience.github.io/Chapter_02/Obtaining_Datasets_with_DANDI.html), we demonstrated how to download a particular DANDIset. Modify this code to download another dataset, and dig in to see what's there.
# 2. In [Chapter 2.2](https://neuraldatascience.github.io/Chapter_02/Working_with_NWB_format_in_Python.html) we demonstrated how to create a dataframe with all of the units (possible neurons) that were recorded. How would you filter this dataframe for only "good" units?
