    "This online textbook will provide interactive resources for researchers, educators, and students who would like to use open neuroscience datasets for research and teaching. This book will provide tutorials in the form of interactive notebooks and videos for how to use Python to wrangle neuroscience datasets, with a focus on [Neuroscience Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) datasets. The emphasis is on data mining and wrangling rather than analysis. Soon, this will be built out into a fully comprehensive guide including all of these aspects of neural data science.\n",
