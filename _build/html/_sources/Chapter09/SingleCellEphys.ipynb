This technology is called the **Cre-Lox system**, and is a common way in neuroscience (and some other fields) to target cells based on their expression of specific genetic promotors. For more information about Cre/Lox technology, see [this website](https://old.abmgood.com/marketing/knowledge_base/Cre-Lox_Recombination.php). Information about the different Cre lines that are available can be found in [this glossary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZMMZgc7cS5BHhoWNqzjw95BdxOuj5wrYl9I7PV2HeUI/edit?usp=sharing) or on the [Allen Institute's website](http://connectivity.brain-map.org/transgenic).\n",
