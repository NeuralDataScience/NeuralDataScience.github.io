# Data Science in Python

The notebooks in this section will prepare you for using Python for Data Science. You can skip this section if you're feeling great about your Python abilities.

The intention here isn’t to teach you how to code in Python — we’re hoping you’re picking this book up with some basic Python knowledge already. If you don’t have that, we recommend the following resources:

* [Software Carpentry, Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) or [Plotting & Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/): 
* [VanderPlas, Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) 
* [VanderPlas, Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) (available free online or in print),  
* [Adhikari, DeNero, and Wagner, “Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science”](https://inferentialthinking.com/)
