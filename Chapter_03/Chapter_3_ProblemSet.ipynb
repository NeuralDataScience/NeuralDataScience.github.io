    "# Chapter 3 Problem Set\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In [3.1](https://neuraldatascience.github.io/Chapter_02/Working_with_NWB_format_in_Python.html), we created two functions. One of these functions plots binned firing rates over time. Modify this function to accept a NumPy array that is neurons x spike times, and to plot an average firing rate over time. Bonus: add a shaded standard deviation around your average firing rate.\n",
    "2. In [3.1](https://neuraldatascience.github.io/Chapter_02/Sample_Visualizations.html), we looked at the Economo & Svoboda (2018) extracellular data and produced a table of trial times. In 2.2, we showed how to plot a PSTH for single neurons. Use the `interval_trial` table we created in 2.2 to find trials where the mouse either had a \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" response. Take an average of firing rates across all neurons in the incorrect and correct, and plot. Is there a difference?\n",
    "3. Create a plot that compares the average firing rate for each brain area.\n",
    "4. Using the `spykes` package, create a plot that is a peristimulus histogram for all gabor stimuli at 90 degrees.\n",
    "5. Use the code provided in 3.3 to compare the waveforms of Sst+ cells with non-Sst+ cells and PV+ cells. Are they the same?"
