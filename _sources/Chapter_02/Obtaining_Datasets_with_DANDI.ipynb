    "[DANDI](https://www.dandiarchive.org/) is an open source data archive for neuroscience datasets, called **Dandisets**. DANDI allows scientists to submit and download neural datasets to promote research collaboration and consistent and transparent data standards. DANDI also [provides a solution](https://www.dandiarchive.org/handbook/01_introduction/) to the difficulties that come from housing data in the many other general domains (i.e. Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.). Usefully for our purposes here, many of the datasets on DANDI are in NWB format.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary ways to work with Dandisets:\n",
    "1. You can **download the datasets locally**, either via the [DANDI Web Application](https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/dandiset) or using the DANDI Python client below. If you download via the website, you'll need to create an account.\n",
    "2. You can **stream datasets directly** from DANDI (under development).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we demonstrate how to do both of these. For additional information on either of these methods, please refer to the [DANDI documentation](https://gui.dandiarchive.org/). "
